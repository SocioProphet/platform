This seed provides the basic components that should be installed on an
Ubuntu-family desktop system. It is expected to be supplemented with a
particular flavour of desktop environment (e.g. GNOME, KDE, or XFCE).

= Hardware and Architecture Support =

== Architecture-independent ==

 * alsa-base # needed for proper hardware detection (hotplug/blacklist.d, modprobe.d)
 * alsa-utils           # basic audio support and mixer level handling
 * (pcmciautils)        # PCMCIA support for >= 2.6.13-rc1 kernels
 * inputattach          # needed for serial mice

Power management:

 * (acpi-support)
 * (libgl1-mesa-dri) # needed for composite/3D on free graphics drivers

Bluetooth:
TODO not for Xubuntu

 * (bluez-utils) # base for bluetooth support
 * (bluez-cups)  # allow connecting to bluetooth printers from CUPS

== armel ==

 * apmd [armel]

== ppc32, ppc64 ==

 * pbbuttonsd [powerpc]

= Console-Based Tools =

These tools are very commonly used by people who drop into a console shell to do some work.

 * bc
 * dc
 * genisoimage
 * (wodim)
 * (cdparanoia)
 * (dvd+rw-tools)
 * screen
 * lftp
 * zip
 * unzip                # also used for .zip support in file-roller
 * libpam-ck-connector  # get ConsoleKit sessions for VTs

= Network Services =

Basic network services and Windows integration.

 * wireless-tools
 * wpasupplicant  # ScottJamesRemnant
 * (libnss-mdns)       # IPv4 link-local DNS support
 * smbclient           # to access files on other SAMBA and Windows servers
 * ca-certificates     # common SSL certificates

These packages help with system integration

 * libsasl2-modules    # allows integration with MTA and login system
 * (avahi-daemon)      # some people do not like it, and it is not essential

= Printing =

Printing and printer configuration is a real weak spot in Debian, and in Linux in general. We will need to stay at the front of the curve here.

 * cups                       # our preferred printer management infrastructure
 * cups-bsd                   # gives us lpc, lpq, lpr, lprm
 * cups-client                # gives us cancel, cupstestppd, lp, lpoptions, lppasswd, lpstat, cupsaddsmb, accept, lpadmin, lpinfo, lpmove
 * foomatic-db-engine           # integrate the foomatic printer driver engine
 * foomatic-db                  # the foomatic printer driver database
 * foomatic-filters             # converter from postscript to printer-specific formats
 * openprinting-ppds            # Most common drivers we want in desktop; less common are in o-p-extra
 * pnm2ppa                      # several ppds require this
 * ghostscript-x
 * (hplip)     			# support for HP all-in-one printers
 * (min12xxw)			# support for KonicaMinolta PagePro 1200W, 1300W printers
 * (foo2zjs)			# support for printing to ZjStream-based printers
 * (splix)			# support for Samsung lasers
 * (pxljr)			# support for HP Color lasers

= GUI infrastructure =

Packages used for X preconfiguration are just Recommends; removing them after initial installation should be relatively safe.

 * (laptop-detect)

 * xorg                          # this includes xserver-xorg->xserver-xorg-{input|video}-* (no need to add specific drivers manually)
 * xkb-data                      # XKB data now lives here

Fonts:

 * x-ttcidfont-conf
 * ttf-dejavu-core
 * ttf-freefont
 * (ttf-kacst)
 * (ttf-wqy-zenhei)
 * (ttf-vlgothic)
 * (ttf-indic-fonts-core)
 * (ttf-thai-tlwg)
 * (ttf-lao)

= Development =

Here we provide a minimal development environment sufficient to build kernel
drivers, so that this is possible on the live CD and in scenarios where
it is problematic to get these packages onto the installed system in order
to compile a driver. -mdz

 * (gcc)
 * (make)
 * (linux-headers-generic) [i386]
 * (linux-headers-powerpc) [powerpc]
 * (linux-headers-powerpc64-smp) [powerpc]
 * (linux-headers-generic) [amd64]
 * (linux-headers-ia64) [ia64]
 * (linux-headers-sparc64) [sparc]
 * (linux-headers-hppa32) [hppa]
 * (linux-headers-hppa64) [hppa]
 * (linux-headers-lpia) [lpia]
 * (linux-headers-imx51) [armel]

= Other =

 * anacron # generally appropriate for desktops
 * (bogofilter) # TODO not for Xubuntu
 * usplash # also needs theme provided by specific desktop seed
 * libxp6 # required for some third party apps. See #15739
 * sreadahead

= Germinate workarounds =

 * libgl1-mesa-glx # depended upon by freeglut3
