== Filesystems ==

These are commonly used filesystem support packages, here because someone setting up a server would begin with standard, configure filesystems and network and then add other services. NFS is explicitly not here, because it brings in nasties like portmap, and because the network will need to be running before it can be used, so we may as well put that in Supported.

 * dosfstools
 * hfsutils [powerpc]
 * (ntfs-3g)
 * (uuid-runtime) # we use UUIDs by default, so make it easy to generate them

== Networking ==

These provide various networking services, all should be configured in a client-only state with the server de-activated unless the user requires it.

 * (ppp)
 * (pppconfig)
 * (pppoeconf)
 * (openssh-client) # ColinWatson
 * wget           # FabioMassimoDiNitto

= Debugging and Diagnostics =

A base system should be a good platform for diagnostics about the hardware and network. In other words, after installing just the Base system one should have everything one might need to get the rest of the system up and running the way you want it.

These are used for debugging problems or examining the system.

 * (strace)
 * (dmidecode)
 * (lshw)
 * (lsof)
 * (ltrace)

= Helpful Tools =
 
 * (friendly-recovery)    # give a nice menu in recovery mode
 * (command-not-found)
 * (update-manager-core)  # needed for server based release upgrades
 * (apparmor) # load AppArmor policies
 * (plymouth) # splash screen, and boot-time questions
 * (plymouth-theme-ubuntu-text) # TODO: we don't have a custom fallback yet

== Network ==

 * (ntp)  # added for elementary OS (usually it's installed when you manually enable time sync)
